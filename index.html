           <br> <center><h2>10th Grade</h2></center>
           <br> The topic that 10th graders start with in the beginning of the school year is processing. Processing is getting a little more advanced than python. It starts to really challenge the student's creativity and the ability to make something from their creativity.  
           <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/172696">
             <br><button id="btn" type="button" class="btn btn-info slideanim" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">See a processing project here</button>
           </a>
           <br> The next topic 10th graders face is Electronics. They get to use something called Arduino. Arduino is an inexpensive open-source microcontroller. Students get to mess around with the curcuit's in Arduino, and eventually make a project with the circuits.
           <br>The last topic that 10th grader have is data. Data is like analytics. You see what the people think through information collected by various techniques. It can also be used to compare various things like sales, company reports, and feedback on certain things.

                <h2>Grading Requirement</h2>
                <br> In the software engineering program there are 3 inputs that go into what your grade is. One input is assesments, which is worth 50% of your grade.
                <br> This includes quizzes projects and updating your portfolio. This means that in order to be successful in software engineering program you must study
                <br> what you learn in class. It is also good to practice what you learn by just coding in order to understand what you just learned.
                <br> Homework is worth 20% of your grade which means you have to do your homework because often times the day after, the lesson is based
                <br> off the homework. So if you don't do your homework you will fall behind. Lastly classwork participation is worth 30% of your grade. This means
                <br> coming to class on time, participating, and making sure your not off task.
              </div>

              <div class='col-xs-6 col-sm-4' id='op'>
                <h2>Opprotunities</h2> There are many opprotunities that come with software engineering program. You get to go to feild trips such as
                <br> google and the huffington post. There is also hackathons, pathfinders, and internship that many students attend while
                <br> in SEP. SEP also offers programs during the summer that helps improve students coding. Lastly, there is also a
                <br> cool year-end showcase that students do to show off the cool work that they did throughout the year.

                    <p>
                      <br> Another way to be successful in software engineering is to attend tutoring. Tutoring is helpul for many things. If you do not understand a subject than you should attend tutoring.
                      <br> If you want to practice what you learned attend tutoring. Tutoring is also useful if you are falling behind in a project.
                      <br>Many people in tutoring can help you catch up.</p>

                Scratch is aimed at young children
                <br> in order to teach them how to code.
                <br> It is a great place to learn how to
                <br> code, and really understand what
                <br>it means to code. I used scratch
                <br> and got hooked into coding after
                <br> using it. Don't believe me see a
                <br> project below.
