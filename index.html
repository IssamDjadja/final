                <p class="overflow ellipsis">
                  <wbr> In the software engineering program there are 3 inputs that go into what your grade is. One input is assesments, which is worth 50% of your grade.
                  <wbr> This includes quizzes projects and updating your portfolio. This means that in order to be successful in software engineering program you must study
                  <wbr> what you learn in class. It is also good to practice what you learn by just coding in order to understand what you just learned.
                  <wbr> Homework is worth 20% of your grade which means you have to do your homework because often times the day after, the lesson is based
                  <wbr> off the homework. So if you don't do your homework you will fall behind. Lastly classwork participation is worth 30% of your grade. This means
                  <wbr> coming to class on time, participating, and making sure your not off task.</p>

                <h2>Opprotunities</h2>
                <p overflow: hidden;>There are many opprotunities that come with software engineering program. You get to go to feild trips such as
                  <wbr> google and the huffington post. There is also hackathons, pathfinders, and internship that many students attend while
                  <wbr> in SEP. SEP also offers programs during the summer that helps improve students coding. Lastly, there is also a
                  <wbr> cool year-end showcase that students do to show off the cool work that they did throughout the year.</p>

                    <p overflow: hidden;>
                      <wbr> Another way to be successful in software engineering is to attend tutoring. Tutoring is helpul for many things. If you do not understand a subject than you should attend tutoring.
                      <wbr> If you want to practice what you learned attend tutoring. Tutoring is also useful if you are falling behind in a project.
                      <wbr>Many people in tutoring can help you catch up.</p>

                  Scratch is aimed at young children
                  <wbr> in order to teach them how to code.
                  <wbr> It is a great place to learn how to
                  <wbr> code, and really understand what
                  <wbr>it means to code. I used scratch
                  <wbr> and got hooked into coding after
                  <wbr> using it. Don't believe me see a
