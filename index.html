                <br>
                <br> In the software engineering program there are 3 inputs that go into what
                <wbr> your grade is. One input is assesments, which is worth 50% of your grade.
                <wbr> This includes quizzes projects and updating your portfolio. This means that in
                <wbr> order to be successful in software engineering program you must study what you
                <wbr> learn in class. It is also good to practice what you learn by just coding in order to
                <wbr> understand what you just learned. Homework is worth 20% of your grade which
                <wbr> means you have to do your homework because often times the day after
                <wbr> the lesson is based off the homework. So if you don't do your homework you will
                <wbr> fall behind. Lastly classwork participation is worth 30% of your grade.
                <wbr> This means coming to class on time, participating,
                <wbr> and making sure your not off task.

                <br>
                <br> There are many opprotunities that come with software engineering program.
                <wbr> You get to go to feild trips such as google and the huffington post. is also hackathons,
                <br>
                <wbr> pathfinders, and internship that many students attend while in SEP. SEP also offers
                <wbr> programs during the summer that helps improve students coding.
                <br>
                <wbr> Lastly, there is also a cool year-end showcase that students
                <wbr> do to show off the cool work that they did throughout the year.

                    Another way to be successful in software
                    <wbr> engineering is to attend tutoring. Tutoring is helpul for many things.
                    <br> If you do not understand a subject or feel you need more practice.
                    <wbr> If you want to practice what you learned attend tutoring.
                    <br>
                    <wbr> Tutoring is also useful if you are falling behind in a project.
                    <wbr> Many people in tutoring can help you catch up.

            <br> The topic that 10th graders start with in the
            <wbr>beginning of the school year is processing.
            <wbr> Processing is getting a little more advanced than python.
            <wbr> It starts to really challenge
            <wbr> the student's creativity
            <wbr> and the ability to make something from their creativity.

            <br>
            <br> The next topic 10th graders face is Electronics. They get to
            <wbr>use something called Arduino. Arduino is an inexpensive
            <wbr> open-source microcontroller. Students get to
            <br> mess around with the curcuit's in Arduino, and
            <wbr> eventually make a project with the circuits.

            <br>The last topic that 10th grader have is data. Data is like analytics.
            <wbr>You see what the people think through information collected
            <wbr> by various techniques.
            <br> It can also be used to compare various things like
            <wbr> sales, company reports, and feedback on certain things.

            <br><wbr>11th grders start their year off learning about Github. Github is a
            <br><wbr>great place to code because all of your code is stored in a cloud
            <br><wbr>where y can visually track the changes you make, and can
            <br><wbr>collaborate with people pretty easily. So 11th graders get to 
            <br><wbr>coding with a partner and combining their ideas so that they 
            <br><wbr>can make cool projects.

            <br><wbr>After students get comfortable with github students than start to
            <br><wbr>learn about different coding languages such as HTML, CSS,
            <br><wbr>JavaScript, Jquerry, and Bootstrap. The 11th graders begin 
            <br><wbr>begin to see the differrences and the similarities between the 
            <br><wbr>languages, and get to expirience just how hard coding can be.
